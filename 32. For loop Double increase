//Same with basic for loop, but instead of increasing by one. now we are increasing it by 2


using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) //for every loop going through, increase it by 2.
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i);
        }
    }
}

Output
