This is from (https://www.dotnetperls.com/2d) 
Basic understanding of 2D array.
GetupperBound. - This method receives the highest indes of the specified rank. 

using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string[,] codes = new string[,]  //[,] indicates string is 2d array
        {
            {"AA", "BB"},
            {"CC", "DD"}
        };

        // Get the upper bound.
        // ... Use for-loop over rows.
        for (int i = 0; i <= codes.GetUpperBound(0); i++)  //GetUpperBound(0) means i is equal to first column to the last column which will be 0 and 1
        {
            string s1 = codes[i, 0];
            string s2 = codes[i, 1];
            Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}", s1, s2); // this basically saying Console.WriteLine([0,0] [0,1]) and Console.WriteLine([1,0] [1,1]) 
        }
    }
}

during this example I learned how to use the GetUpperBound function in 2D array.
