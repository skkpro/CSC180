2D Array Examples - Dotnetperls
Length-based loop -The fastest method for a 2D array is to do some arithmetic. 


using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string[,] words = new string[,]  // given the 2D array string words
        {
            {"ONE", "TWO"},
            {"THREE", "FOUR"},
            {"FIVE", "SIX"}                //it's length of the words are 6. 2 colums * 3 rows
        };

        // Loop based on length.
        // ... Assumes each subarray is two elements long.
        for (int i = 0; i < words.Length / 2; i++)  // for loop to find out how many rows there are in the strings.
        {
            string s1 = words[i, 0];
            string s2 = words[i, 1];
            Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}", s1, s2);
        }
    }
}

This is faster than GetUpperBound method, simple to use.
