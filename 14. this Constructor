        Mouse mouse1 = new Mouse(); 
        //reason why we gave this constructor. When a user doesnt give a value to the constructor, system will
        //automatically call the constructor: this and give the value with it.
        
        Mouse mouse2 = new Mouse(10, "Sam");
    }
}

Output

Constructor weight = -1, name =  //value from this constructor.
Constructor weight = 10, name = Sam
